# Dementia-Related Paranoia: Concise Medication & Follow‑Up Playbook

> **Purpose:** A practical, concise summary of first‑line medication options often used off‑label to reduce paranoia/psychosis in dementia, plus a structured follow‑up plan for **quetiapine (Seroquel)** in **frail** patients.
>
> **Disclaimer:** Educational summary only. Not medical advice. Medication decisions must be individualized by a licensed clinician who knows the patient’s diagnosis, comorbidities, meds, and goals of care.

## 1) Medication Sequence & Starter Doses (lowest‑effective‑dose strategy)

**Recommended trial order (with geriatric‑friendly starting doses):**

1. **Quetiapine (Seroquel)** — *first choice when medication becomes necessary*
   - **Start:** **12.5 mg qHS** (night) in most; consider **6.25 mg qHS** in **frail** patients (¼ of a 25‑mg tablet) if red‑flag risk is high.
   - **Titrate:** Increase cautiously by **6.25–12.5 mg** no more often than every **3–7 days**, aiming for the **lowest dose that reduces distress**.
   - **Typical working range in dementia:** **6.25–50 mg/day** (often qHS).
   - **Why first:** Lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms; better tolerated in Parkinson’s/Lewy‑body phenotypes; “edge‑softening” without strong motor effects.  
   *(Evidence & guidance: UIowa Dementia Antipsychotic Prescribing Guide; AAFP review; Alzheimer’s Society cautions & non‑drug‑first principle.)*

2. **Risperidone (Risperdal)** — *effective at tiny doses but higher stroke/EPS risk*
   - **Start:** **0.25 mg qHS** (or **0.25 mg BID** if daytime paranoia dominates); in very frail, **0.125–0.25 mg qHS**.
   - **Titrate:** By **0.25 mg** every **4–7 days** only if needed; typical target **0.25–1 mg/day**.
   - **Why second:** Stronger anti‑delusional effect at low dose, but higher risk of EPS, stroke/TIA; avoid or use extreme caution in Parkinsonian/Lewy‑body syndromes.  
   *(Evidence & guidance: UIowa guide; AAFP review; Alzheimer’s Society cautions.)*

3. **Olanzapine (Zyprexa)** — *reserve option when others fail or are intolerable*
   - **Start:** **2.5 mg qHS** in most; **1.25–2.5 mg qHS** in the very frail.
   - **Titrate:** By **2.5 mg** no more often than every **7 days**; typical target **2.5–7.5 mg/day**.
   - **Why third:** Broader receptor effects, more sedation and metabolic burden; can overly blunt cognition/engagement in frailty.  
   *(Evidence & guidance: UIowa guide; AAFP review; Alzheimer’s Society cautions.)*

> **Global principles:** Always try non‑drug measures first; use time‑limited trials; document target symptom(s); use the **lowest effective dose**; schedule periodic attempts to taper/stop.  
> *(Choosing Wisely/geriatrics recommendations; Alzheimer’s Society overview; Better Health While Aging practical guidance.)*

## 2) Quetiapine Follow‑Up Protocol (with frailty focus)

### A. Establish Baseline (before first dose)
- Brief **orientation**: person/place/time.
- **Speech/language**: word‑finding, spontaneity, ability to hold a conversational thread.
- **Goal‑directed behavior/ADLs**: initiation and follow‑through.
- **Paranoia profile**: frequency, intensity, triggers, consequences (safety, refusal of care).
- Document vitals, hydration, pain, sleep, acute illnesses (e.g., UTI), sensory issues (vision/hearing).  
*(Rationale from dementia care guidance emphasizing non‑drug drivers and baseline establishment.)*

### B. Dosing & First Week Plan
- **Start**: 12.5 mg qHS (or **6.25 mg qHS** if frail/high‑risk).
- **Early check‑ins**: **24–72 hours** (phone or nurse report) to detect oversedation or delirium.
- **One‑week visit or call**: assess cognition, speech, behavior.

### C. What to Monitor (the “red‑flag bundle”)
Watch specifically for **new/worse**:
- **Disorientation** (time/place/people)
- **Word‑finding difficulty** (more pauses, substitutions)
- **Loss of conversational thread** (can’t stay on topic, trails off)
- **Decreased spontaneous speech** (speaks only when prompted)
- **Reduced goal‑directed behavior** (needs more cueing for ADLs)

Also track: daytime sleepiness, gait changes/falls, orthostasis, anticholinergic burden, new infections/pain, environmental triggers (lighting, routine disruptions).  
*(Aligned with geriatric antipsychotic cautions and non‑drug‑first frameworks.)*

### D. If Red Flags Appear
1. **Assume dose intolerance**, especially in frailty.
2. **Reduce dose** promptly:
   - 12.5 mg qHS → **6.25 mg qHS**, or 
   - 12.5 mg **every other night**.
3. **Reassess in 3–7 days** for cognitive recovery and paranoia control.
4. If cognition rebounds **and** paranoia remains tolerable → **continue** at the lower dose.
5. If cognition rebounds **but** paranoia returns to high‑distress → do **not** simply push dose back up in frailty; re‑evaluate triggers, optimize non‑drug strategies, and consider proceeding to **Risperidone** trial.
6. If cognition **doesn’t** rebound despite dose reduction → **discontinue** quetiapine and re‑assess diagnosis/causes (delirium, infection, dehydration, polypharmacy).

### E. When to “Call It Quits” on Quetiapine
- Persistent red flags or functional decline despite dose minimization.
- Need for doses above the “frailty window” to control symptoms.
- Emergence of adverse events (falls, orthostasis, worsening confusion, suspected stroke/TIA).
- Lack of meaningful benefit on the **target symptom** after an adequate, time‑limited trial (e.g., 2–4 weeks at best‑tolerated dose).

### F. Hand‑Off to Next Option
- **If quetiapine not tolerated or ineffective:**
  - Trial **risperidone** at **0.25 mg qHS** (or **0.25 mg BID** if daytime symptoms dominate); in very frail, **0.125–0.25 mg qHS**. Titrate slowly by **0.25 mg** q4–7d only if needed.
  - Reserve **olanzapine** (start **2.5 mg qHS**, or **1.25–2.5 mg** if very frail) for cases where both quetiapine/risperidone fail or are contraindicated.
- Re‑apply the same **baseline → red‑flag surveillance → minimal effective dose → time‑limited trial** framework.

## 3) Non‑Drug Practices to Pair With Any Trial (high‑yield)
- Remove **triggers** (pain, infection, constipation, sleep disruption, sensory deprivation).
- Optimize **environment** (consistent routine, evening lighting for sundowning, clear signage/labels, familiar objects).
- Use **validation and reassurance**, not confrontation; simplify choices and instructions.
- Reassess for **anticholinergics/benzos** and other deliriogenic meds to deprescribe when possible.
