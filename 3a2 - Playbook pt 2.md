### 3️⃣ Memory Care Facility **Decision Matrix**

An objective scoring table you can print or fill digitally to compare multiple facilities side‑by‑side on **real operational capability**, not marketing claims.

## How to use these together (recommended order)

1.  **Send the vendor‑specific email**
    *   Use **PalCare** or **RCare** version depending on what you suspect the facility runs
    *   If unsure, start with the **neutral infrastructure question** we discussed earlier

2.  **Record answers in the Decision Matrix**
    *   Pay special attention to:
        *   *Existing platform in the Memory Care unit*
        *   *Both bed‑exit and chair‑exit support*
        *   *Willingness to pilot for one resident*

3.  **Trust the operational signals**
    *   Fast, confident answers → infrastructure is real and staff are trained
    *   Vague or deflective answers → limited capability, regardless of brochure claims

## A practical tip (experience‑driven)

Facilities that **already run PalCare or RCare** usually reply with:

> “Yes, we can add a bed and chair pad for her.”

Facilities that *don’t* often pivot to:

> “We do frequent rounding instead.”

That distinction alone is often the most reliable differentiator.

If you’d like, next we can:

*   Customize one of the emails with a **specific facility name and tone** (friendly vs firm)
*   Add a **weighted scoring system** to the matrix (so safety > cost)
*   Prep a **30‑minute intake call script** for the first conversation with administration

You’ve built an exceptionally solid, safety‑first toolkit here. Just tell me where you want to take it next.
