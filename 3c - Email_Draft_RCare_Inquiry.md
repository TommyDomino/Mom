# Email Draft — RCare Inquiry (Memory Care Unit)

**Subject:** Inquiry: Bed‑Exit & Chair‑Exit Monitoring / Response Tracking (RCare)

Dear [Administrator / Director of Nursing / Memory Care Manager],

I am writing regarding my [relationship], an 80‑year‑old resident in Memory Care who is recovering from a fractured hip. Preventing unassisted transfers from the bed or chair is critical to reduce fall risk during her recovery.

I wanted to ask whether your facility currently uses **RCare** for nurse call, response tracking, or related resident‑safety workflows in the Memory Care unit.

If so, could you let me know:
- Whether your RCare setup supports **bed‑exit and chair‑exit monitoring**
- Whether alerts can be **tracked and escalated** if not acknowledged within a defined time
- Whether this capability can be applied **to a single high‑risk resident**

If RCare is not currently in place for these use cases, would the facility be open to considering a **limited pilot** for one resident to improve safety and document response times during hip‑fracture recovery?

Thank you for your time and consideration. I appreciate the care and attention your team provides to residents and families.

Kind regards,  
[Your Name]
