# Email Draft — PalCare Inquiry (Memory Care Unit)

**Subject:** Inquiry: Bed‑Exit & Chair‑Exit Monitoring Support (PalCare)

Dear [Administrator / Director of Nursing / Memory Care Manager],

I am writing regarding my [relationship], who is an 80‑year‑old resident with a recent hip fracture. As she recovers, preventing *unassisted transfers* from both the bed and chair is extremely important to avoid a secondary fall.

I wanted to ask whether your Memory Care unit currently uses **PalCare** for nurse call or resident monitoring, including **PalCare Mobile** alerts to staff.

If so, could you please let me know:
- Whether **bed‑exit and chair‑exit sensor pads** are supported by your current PalCare configuration
- Whether these sensors could be enabled **for a single resident** as part of her care plan

If PalCare is not currently deployed in this unit, would your team be open to discussing a **limited safety pilot** for one high‑risk resident during hip‑fracture recovery?

We understand there may be operational or subscription considerations, and we would be happy to discuss how this could be scoped appropriately for one resident if it improves safety.

Thank you very much for your time and for the care your team provides.

Sincerely,  
[Your Name]
