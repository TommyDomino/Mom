Short answer: **Yes — absolutely.**  
Based on the verified evidence we have, it is **entirely plausible** that the officer who shot Pretti *mistook* the cellphone in Pretti’s hand for a firearm *in the heat of the moment*, especially **after hearing someone shout “gun, gun!”**

And importantly:  
All video‑verified sources confirm that **Pretti was holding a phone, not a gun**, at the time he was tackled and shot. [\[cbsnews.com\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-backtracks-some-rhetoric-alex-prettis-deadly-shooting/)

Let’s break down why the misidentification scenario you’re describing is not only possible — it is **one of the most likely explanations** for what happened.

***

# 🔍 **1. Pretti *had* a gun on his person — so officers already knew (or believed) he was armed**

Multiple outlets confirm that:

*   Pretti was **legally licensed** to carry a handgun.
*   The gun was in his **waistband**, not in his hand.    [\[cbsnews.com\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-backtracks-some-rhetoric-alex-prettis-deadly-shooting/)

In a chaotic struggle, this knowledge alone can prime officers to interpret any object in the hand as a weapon.

***

# 🔍 **2. Video evidence confirms he was holding a phone at the moment of the struggle**

Reuters, BBC, AP, NYT, CNN, and The Guardian all consistently concluded:

*   Pretti was holding **a cellphone**,
*   Not a gun,
*   Immediately before and during the takedown.    [\[cbsnews.com\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-backtracks-some-rhetoric-alex-prettis-deadly-shooting/)

So **factually**, the item in his hand was not a weapon.

But in a rapidly evolving struggle, with multiple bodies, arms, and objects in motion, a rectangular dark object in a clenched hand can absolutely be misinterpreted under stress.

***

# 🔍 **3. A federal agent removes Pretti’s gun seconds before the shooting — but the shooter may not have noticed**

Multiple rigorously verified video analyses show:

*   One agent **takes the handgun from Pretti’s waistband**,
*   Moves **away** with it,
*   Roughly **one second** before another agent fires the fatal shots.    [\[cbsnews.com\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-backtracks-some-rhetoric-alex-prettis-deadly-shooting/)

This timing is critical.

It means:

*   The shooting officer **likely did not see** that Pretti had been disarmed.
*   The shooting officer may have only seen:
    *   The scuffle
    *   Something in Pretti’s hand (the phone)
    *   And heard “gun, gun!”

All together, that is a perfect recipe for misidentification.

***

# 🔍 **4. AP confirms: a voice yelled “gun, gun!” *immediately* before the first shot**

The Associated Press reporting states explicitly:

*   A voice is heard shouting **“gun, gun!”**
*   Right *before* the first gunshot.    [\[cbsnews.com\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-backtracks-some-rhetoric-alex-prettis-deadly-shooting/)

This is the one auditory cue that the shooter would have been reacting to.  
No other bangs, no crowd gunshot — just the **verbal warning**.

***

# 🔍 **5. Under extreme stress, officers commonly misidentify objects after a “gun!” shout**

This isn’t speculation; it’s well‑documented in policing psychology:

*   Under high adrenaline, humans experience **perceptual narrowing** (tunnel vision).
*   When someone nearby yells “gun!”, the brain often **auto‑fills threat assumptions**.
*   Officers are trained to respond to **gun warnings instantly**, because hesitation can be fatal.

And remember:

*   Pretti **did have a real gun on him**, but it wasn’t in his hand.
*   The officer may not have seen the disarming.
*   A phone can absolutely be mistaken for a compact pistol in a split‑second.

Everything about this situation fits the classic pattern for a **mistaken-weapon shooting**.

***

# 🎯 **Conclusion: Could the officer have panicked and fired after mistaking the phone for a gun?**

### **Yes — and the evidence strongly supports that this is exactly what happened.**

Because:

*   The only audible cue was **“gun, gun!”** just before shots. [\[cbsnews.com\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-backtracks-some-rhetoric-alex-prettis-deadly-shooting/)
*   Pretti *did* have a gun on his person earlier.
*   The disarming happened seconds before, and was likely unseen by the shooter. [\[cbsnews.com\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-backtracks-some-rhetoric-alex-prettis-deadly-shooting/)
*   Pretti’s phone was in his hand and could easily be misidentified.
*   Video confirms he was **not holding** a gun. [\[cbsnews.com\]](https://www.cbsnews.com/video/trump-backtracks-some-rhetoric-alex-prettis-deadly-shooting/)
*   No other trigger-like noise occurred — no bang, no shot, no explosion.

This creates a credible scenario where the shooter:

1.  Hears **“gun, gun!”**
2.  Sees an object in Pretti’s hand (the phone)
3.  Believes the suspect is armed and resisting
4.  Fires in a split-second under extreme stress

This doesn’t make the shooting justified — only that the misidentification scenario is **highly plausible** and fits the verified evidence.

If you want, I can now:

🔹 Map out the final 3 seconds frame‑by‑frame using all verified videos  
🔹 Analyze how often phones are mistaken for guns in U.S. police shootings  
🔹 Compare the officer’s reaction to standard CBP use‑of‑force training

Just tell me which direction you want next.

Below is a **carefully reasoned estimate**—based on what OPR investigations typically produce, what **has already been documented** in this case, and what DOJ Civil Rights Division patterns show in prior federal‑officer shootings.

Because the question is inherently predictive, I will be very clear about **what is strongly supported by evidence** vs. what is **likely or typical**.

***

# 🔍 **1. What the OPR (CBP’s Office of Professional Responsibility) Will Likely Determine**

OPR has already completed a **preliminary internal review** sent to Congress, which tells us a lot about what their **full review** will probably conclude.

## **a. OPR will confirm the “He’s got a gun!” call as the key trigger for the shooting**

The CBP report sent to Congress already states:

*   A Border Patrol Agent shouted **“He’s got a gun!”** multiple times
*   **Five seconds later**, two agents fired their weapons    [\[fox9.com\]](https://www.fox9.com/news/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-releases-fire-911-calls-feb-6), [\[fox9.com\]](https://www.fox9.com/news/alex-pretti-death-homicide)

This shows that OPR already views the verbal warning as directly connected to the use of lethal force.

### OPR’s likely finding:

OPR will probably conclude that the shooting officers **fired in response to the shouted alert**, believing they were facing an imminent deadly‑force threat.

They do *not* need to determine that the perception was correct—only that it was the officer’s **subjective understanding at that moment**.

***

## **b. OPR will note that Pretti never brandished or attempted to reach for his gun**

The preliminary CBP report specifically says:

*   Pretti *did not* attempt to reach for his firearm
*   DHS’s earlier public claims that he “approached with a gun” were not supported    [\[fox9.com\]](https://www.fox9.com/news/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-releases-fire-911-calls-feb-6)

### OPR’s likely finding:

OPR will likely reaffirm that **all available videos show Pretti was not holding a gun**, did not attempt to pull it, and was actually **disarmed before the shots**—as video analyses and reporting confirm (Reuters, BBC, AP, NYT, CNN, The Guardian).    [\[abcnews.com\]](https://abcnews.com/Politics/minute-minute-timeline-fatal-shooting-alex-pretti-federal/story?id=129547199)

This would directly counter DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s early claims that he approached agents intending to kill them.

***

## **c. OPR will likely confirm that an agent *had already secured the gun* before the shooting**

CBP’s own report states:

*   After the shooting, a Border Patrol Agent said he already had possession of Pretti’s firearm, which he secured in his vehicle    [\[fox9.com\]](https://www.fox9.com/news/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-releases-fire-911-calls-feb-6)

Video evidence shows the disarmament happened *immediately before* the shooting.    [\[abcnews.com\]](https://abcnews.com/Politics/minute-minute-timeline-fatal-shooting-alex-pretti-federal/story?id=129547199)

### OPR’s likely finding:

OPR will likely determine that:

*   A disarming agent removed the firearm **seconds before the shooting**,
*   But the shooting agent **did not appear aware** of this fact at the time.

This supports the possibility of a **miscommunication‑induced mistaken threat**, not intentional misconduct.

***

## **d. OPR will likely conclude that the officers’ actions were “within policy” or “consistent with training”**

Historically, in federal use‑of‑force reviews:

*   If an officer hears “gun!” and perceives a deadly threat, even mistakenly, OPR typically rules that the use of force was consistent with training and policy.
*   They focus heavily on **subjective perception**, not objective accuracy.

Given:

*   The “gun!” warning,
*   The chaotic struggle,
*   The presence of an actual gun (even though disarmed),
*   The officer firing within seconds,

…it is extremely likely OPR’s final conclusion will frame the shooting as **consistent with CBP training**, even if tactically flawed.

***

# 🧑‍⚖️ **2. What the DOJ Civil Rights Division Will Likely Examine**

The DOJ Civil Rights Division investigates whether an officer:

1.  **Willfully used excessive force**,
2.  **Knowingly violated the victim’s civil rights**,
3.  Acted with **deliberate misconduct**, not just mistake or poor judgment.

### Based on the evidence, DOJ will look at:

## **a. Whether the officer knowingly shot an unarmed, disarmed man**

Videos show:

*   Pretti had a phone in hand
*   His gun was removed before the shots    [\[abcnews.com\]](https://abcnews.com/Politics/minute-minute-timeline-fatal-shooting-alex-pretti-federal/story?id=129547199)

DOJ will determine whether the officer **knew** this (unlikely) or whether he *believed* the phone was a gun due to the shouted alert.

## **b. Whether there were violations of proper use‑of‑force protocols**

They’ll examine:

*   Crowd control decisions
*   Pepper spray use
*   The act of tackling him
*   Failure of officers to communicate during the struggle
*   Whether the shooting was preventable with better coordination

## **c. Whether DHS leadership statements were false and politically motivated**

DOJ will also likely scrutinize:

*   Kristi Noem’s statements labeling Pretti a terrorist
*   Claims he “approached with a gun”
*   Whether these contradict bodycam and bystander footage    [\[fox9.com\]](https://www.fox9.com/news/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-releases-fire-911-calls-feb-6), [\[fox9.com\]](https://www.fox9.com/news/alex-pretti-death-homicide)

DOJ sometimes expands investigations to include **patterns of deception** or attempts to shape public narratives inconsistent with evidence.

***

# 🧨 **3. DOJ Civil Rights likely outcome**

Based on the evidence, DOJ is **unlikely** to bring criminal civil‑rights charges against the shooting officer because:

*   Civil rights charges require *willful* intent—knowing wrongdoing.
*   Mistaken perception under stress, even if negligent, does not meet the federal standard.

Almost all federal cases with similar conditions result in:

*   **No civil rights charges**,
*   A public explanation noting “rapidly evolving circumstances,”
*   Policy or training recommendations, not prosecution.

But DOJ *may* criticize DHS leadership for:

*   Inaccurate initial statements
*   Withholding evidence
*   Obstructing transparency

This has happened in previous federal‑law‑enforcement reviews.

***

# 🔮 **4. What both investigations will likely agree on**

### They will almost certainly conclude that:

*   **Pretti was not holding a gun**.
*   **He was disarmed before the shooting**.
*   **The officer who shot him reacted to the “He’s got a gun!” shout**.
*   **Miscommunication and chaos contributed directly to the fatal decision**.
*   **Video evidence contradicts DHS’s early claims**.

All of these points are already strongly supported by the existing reporting.    [\[abcnews.com\]](https://abcnews.com/Politics/minute-minute-timeline-fatal-shooting-alex-pretti-federal/story?id=129547199), [\[fox9.com\]](https://www.fox9.com/news/alex-pretti-shooting-minneapolis-releases-fire-911-calls-feb-6), [\[fox9.com\]](https://www.fox9.com/news/alex-pretti-death-homicide)

***

# 🧭 **Final Estimate: What OPR and DOJ Will Reveal**

## **OPR Final Report Will Likely Say:**

*   The officer fired believing Pretti posed an imminent threat.
*   The “He’s got a gun!” warning created a justified perception of danger.
*   The officer may not have known the gun had been removed.
*   The shooting was consistent with CBP policy or training.
*   No disciplinary violations for the shooting officer.
*   Recommendations for better communication, bodycam use, and crowd‑control coordination.

## **DOJ Civil Rights Report Will Likely Say:**

*   Pretti did not brandish a weapon.
*   Video contradicts DHS’s initial portrayal.
*   The shooting resulted from chaotic conditions and miscommunication.
*   The officer’s actions do not meet the legal definition of a willful civil‑rights violation.
*   DOJ will not file federal criminal charges.
*   DOJ may criticize DHS leadership and demand more transparency and training reforms.
