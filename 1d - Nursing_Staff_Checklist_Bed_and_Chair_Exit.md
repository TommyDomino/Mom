## Purpose
Support safe recovery for memory-care residents at high fall risk (e.g., post–hip fracture) by ensuring **bed-exit and chair-exit monitoring** is correctly deployed and maintained.

## Shift Start Checklist
- [ ] Verify bed pad placement (under shoulders/lower back)
- [ ] Verify chair/wheelchair pad placement (centered under seat cushion)
- [ ] Confirm sensors are armed and reporting
- [ ] Test alert delivery to assigned caregiver(s)
- [ ] Review escalation timing and on-call coverage

## During Shift
- [ ] Respond immediately to bed- or chair-exit alerts
- [ ] Assist resident with transfer or return to seated/lying position
- [ ] Re-arm sensor after assistance
- [ ] Observe for repeated alerts indicating discomfort or repositioning needs

## False-Alarm Reduction
- [ ] Re-check pad placement if nuisance alerts occur
- [ ] Ensure pads are flat (no folds or bunching)
- [ ] Adjust sensitivity/escalation per facility policy
- [ ] Document patterns (time of day, activity)

## End of Shift
- [ ] Confirm sensors are active
- [ ] Handoff any recurring issues to next shift
- [ ] Flag equipment needing maintenance or replacement

## Weekly Review (Charge Nurse / Supervisor)
- [ ] Review response-time metrics
- [ ] Identify false-alarm trends
- [ ] Adjust care plan as mobility improves

**Reminder:** Chair-exit alerts often become the *primary* fall-prevention tool during daytime recovery.
