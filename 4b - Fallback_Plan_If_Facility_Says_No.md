# Fallback Plan — If the Facility Says “No” to Pro Nurse‑Call Infrastructure

This plan provides a safe, practical path when a Memory Care facility **does not** have (or will not deploy) a pro nurse‑call system (e.g., PalCare/RCare) for **bed‑exit and chair‑exit monitoring**.

## 1) Immediate Safety (First 24–48 Hours)
- **Deploy a consumer bed alarm** with a pressure‑sensing pad and **remote pager** (e.g., Smart Caregiver Wireless Bed Alarm; Lunderg Early Alert). Choose **vibrate/silent** modes at night to avoid startling the resident.  
- **Add a chair‑exit solution** during the day (chair pad or a motion sensor placed appropriately) and set a **pager vibrate** alert for caregivers.
- **Create a rounding schedule** aligned with high‑risk periods (overnight toileting, early morning first‑stand, post‑meal drowsiness, late‑day sundowning).
- **Document alerts** (time acknowledged, arrival time, outcome). Even a simple log builds accountability and reveals patterns.

## 2) Optimize to Reduce False Alarms (Day 2–7)
- **Bed pad placement:** under **shoulders/lower back**; keep pad flat under the fitted sheet.  
- **Chair pad placement:** centered under the seat cushion; avoid seams and cut‑outs.  
- **Adjust sensitivity/escalation pacing** if alarm fatigue rises; consider slightly longer acknowledge windows for nighttime if safe.  
- **Daily 30‑sec micro‑check:** Sensor armed, pad flat, route to on‑duty caregiver, batteries OK.

## 3) Enhance Coverage (Week 1–2)
- **Add a floor‑mat alarm** at bedside for residents who “slide” rather than stand.  
- **Pair bed + chair**: Bed pad armed overnight; chair pad armed during unsupervised daytime sitting.  
- **Set quiet hours** (pager vibrate) to preserve sleep while maintaining safety.

## 4) Communicate Expectations to Facility
- Provide the unit with your **timeline & checklist** (e.g., Unit Post Binder PDF) and ask staff to **sign off** on shift‑start checks.  
- Request a **weekly 10‑minute huddle** to review alert patterns, response times, and needed tweaks.

## 5) Escalation Path (If Safety Is Still at Risk)
- Ask for a **written rationale** for refusing pro monitoring and whether the decision is **unit‑level or corporate**.  
- Propose a **30‑day pilot** for one resident, with clear goals (e.g., \<= 90‑second acknowledge; \<= 3‑minute arrival; reduced unassisted attempts).  
- If declined, consider a transfer to a facility **with existing infrastructure**, using your **Decision Matrix** to compare options.

## 6) Criteria to Taper Monitoring (When Safe)
- **Zero unassisted attempts for 7 consecutive days**, staff concur, and the clinician approves.  
- **Chair monitoring first** (during fully supervised hours), then **bed monitoring at night**, last.
