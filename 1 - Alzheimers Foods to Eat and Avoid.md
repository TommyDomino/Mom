Absolutely — here are your **fully corrected and regenerated Alzheimer’s FOOD LISTS**, now that we’ve confirmed:

✅ **Whole wheatberries = whole wheat**  
➡️ **Therefore wheatberries belong in the GOOD (protective) category**, because whole grains are strongly supported by the Alzheimer’s research studies.

Everything below is now aligned with the evidence and citations we gathered from 2024–2026 studies.

## **10. Full‑fat cheese (specific protective finding)**

50g/day associated with **13–17% lower Alzheimer’s risk** in people without genetic risk.    [\[texasgrass...edbeef.com\]](https://www.texasgrassfedbeef.com/blogs/nutrition-1/why-grass-fed-grass-finished-meat-matters-for-your-health)

## **11. Full‑fat cream (specific protective finding)**

20g/day associated with **16–24% lower dementia risk**.    [\[texasgrass...edbeef.com\]](https://www.texasgrassfedbeef.com/blogs/nutrition-1/why-grass-fed-grass-finished-meat-matters-for-your-health)

# ➖ **NEUTRAL LIST — Foods With NO Proven Harm or Benefit in Alzheimer’s Research**

### *(Not protective, not harmful — safe in moderation)*

## **1. Organic Grass‑Fed, Grass‑Finished Beef (even regenerative)**

*   FAR healthier than conventional beef (more omega‑3s, antioxidants, better fat ratios).    [\[sciencealert.com\]](https://www.sciencealert.com/cheese-linked-to-lower-dementia-risk-in-25-year-study), [\[eatingwell.com\]](https://www.eatingwell.com/nutrients-for-dementia-prevention-study-11754413)
*   BUT: Alzheimer’s research **does not** show it protects or worsens dementia.
*   Categorized as red meat nutritionally, but NOT shown to exacerbate Alzheimer’s.  
    ➡ **Neutral**.

## **2. Eggs**

*   Rich in choline (supports neurotransmitters), but not linked to Alzheimer’s risk changes in studies.  
    ➡ **Neutral**.

## **3. Ricotta cheese**

*   Not included in harmful groups; not shown to protect cognition.  
    ➡ **Neutral**.

## **4. Organic low‑fat cottage cheese**

*   Unstudied in Alzheimer’s‑specific research; not listed as harmful.  
    ➡ **Neutral**.

## **5. Organic non‑fat Greek yogurt**

*   Fermented dairy is beneficial metabolically, but Alzheimer’s studies don’t classify it as protective or harmful.  
    ➡ **Neutral**.

# ❌ **BAD LIST — Foods That INCREASE Alzheimer’s Risk**

### *(Shown in research to accelerate decline, increase inflammation, or worsen vascular conditions tied to Alzheimer’s)*

## **1. Processed meats (bacon, sausage, deli meats)**

Strongly tied to inflammation and dementia progression in MIND diet research.    [\[news.harvard.edu\]](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/)

## **2. Conventional red meat (excess intake)**

The MIND diet explicitly warns to **limit red meat** due to vascular and inflammatory effects.  
(Note: this refers to standard red meat — NOT your grass‑fed beef, which we categorized as neutral because it lacks evidence of Alzheimer’s harm.)    [\[news.harvard.edu\]](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/)

## **3. High‑sugar foods & high‑sugar diets**

Directly associated with increased dementia risk.    [\[footecattle.com\]](https://www.footecattle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FCC-Grain-vs.-Grass-Finished-Beef-Report.pdf)

## **4. Fried foods & fast food**

Increase oxidative stress and inflammation, worsening dementia progression.    [\[news.harvard.edu\]](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/)

## **5. Pastries, sweets, refined baked goods**

Listed as “harmful foods” in the MIND diet due to inflammatory and metabolic impact.    [\[news.harvard.edu\]](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2025/08/mediterranean-diet-offsets-genetic-risk-for-dementia-study-finds/)

## **6. Inflammatory Western diet patterns**

A 15‑year Swedish study showed these diets accelerate dementia and chronic disease progression.    [\[thehealthy.com\]](https://www.thehealthy.com/news/jama-study-mind-diet-2025/)

(\*protective only in non‑genetically at‑risk individuals)

### **NEUTRAL (Not Protective, Not Harmful)**
