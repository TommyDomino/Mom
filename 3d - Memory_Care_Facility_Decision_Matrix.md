# Memory Care Facility Decision Matrix — Bed & Chair Exit Monitoring

Use this matrix to objectively compare facilities based on their ability and willingness to support **bed‑exit and chair‑exit monitoring** for high‑risk residents (e.g., post–hip fracture).

---

| Criteria | Facility A | Facility B | Facility C |
|---|---|---|---|
| Existing nurse‑call platform (name) |  |  |  |
| Bed‑exit monitoring supported | Yes / No | Yes / No | Yes / No |
| Chair‑exit monitoring supported | Yes / No | Yes / No | Yes / No |
| Silent alerts to staff devices | Yes / No | Yes / No | Yes / No |
| Mobile app / pager alerts | Yes / No | Yes / No | Yes / No |
| Escalation if alert not acknowledged | Yes / No | Yes / No | Yes / No |
| Response‑time tracking available | Yes / No | Yes / No | Yes / No |
| Willing to support **one‑resident pilot** | Yes / No | Yes / No | Yes / No |
| Timeline to enable (if not active) |  |  |  |
| Additional cost for monitoring | None / $$ | None / $$ | None / $$ |
| Staff comfort with technology | High / Med / Low | High / Med / Low | High / Med / Low |
| Overall confidence for fall prevention | High / Med / Low | High / Med / Low | High / Med / Low |

## Scoring Guidance (Optional)
- Prioritize facilities with **existing infrastructure** already in use on the unit
- Strong preference for **both bed‑ and chair‑exit monitoring**
- Escalation and mobile alerts reduce reliance on constant rounding
- Willingness to pilot for one resident indicates operational flexibility

**Tip:** Facilities that answer quickly, clearly, and confidently usually already have the infrastructure and training in place.
