# Pro Nurse‑Call Systems — Single‑Resident Memory Care Comparison

**Scenario Assumption:** One elderly female resident (80+), Memory Care unit, recovering from a fractured hip. Resident is **not bed‑bound**. Primary goals are **bed‑exit and chair‑exit detection** to prevent unassisted transfers and secondary falls.

**Clinical interpretation:**
- **Bed + chair monitoring together** provides 24‑hour fall‑risk coverage for Memory Care residents.
- Chair‑exit alerts typically become the **primary daytime safety control** during hip‑fracture recovery.
- Platforms with escalation and response tracking reduce reliance on constant rounding and help prevent alarm fatigue.
