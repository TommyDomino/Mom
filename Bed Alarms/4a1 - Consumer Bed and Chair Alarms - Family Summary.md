# Consumer Bed & Chair Alarms — Family Summary

Purpose of this document: To clearly explain the two best consumer bed/chair alarm options for home use, based on minimizing false alarms, avoiding startling the person, and notifying family members when someone is getting out of bed or a chair.

## Option 1 (Primary Recommendation): SafeWander® Bed & Chair Exit Alarm

**What it is:**
SafeWander is a wearable bed and chair exit alarm system. Instead of using a pressure pad on the bed or chair, a small sensor is discreetly attached to the person’s clothing. The system detects when the person starts to sit up or stand, and sends alerts directly to caregivers’ phones.

**Why this system was recommended:**
-	Alerts when the person is getting out of bed or standing up from a chair or recliner.
-	Greatly reduces false alarms because it detects body position changes (lying → sitting → standing), not normal movement.
-	Alerts are silent to the person being monitored — no loud alarms in the room.
-	Family members receive alerts on their smartphones, even if they are not in the home.
-	Multiple caregivers can receive alerts at the same time.

**Important limitations to understand:**
-	Requires the person to wear a small sensor clipped to clothing.
-	Does not have a built-in Alexa voice announcement feature (phone alerts are the primary notification method).

## Option 2 (Secondary / Local-Only Option): Lunderg Under‑Mattress Bed & Chair Alarm

**What it is:**
Lunderg uses pressure-sensing pads placed under the mattress and on a chair. When weight is removed, the system alerts a handheld pager carried by a caregiver inside the home.

**Why this system was considered:**
-	Alerts when a person gets out of bed or stands up from a chair.
-	Under-mattress design reduces pad shifting and improves reliability.
-	Early-alert technology helps reduce false alarms compared to basic pressure pads.
-	Pager can be set to vibrate or low volume so the person is not startled.

**Important limitations to understand:**
-	Alerts are local only — family members must be nearby to receive the pager alert.
-	No phone calls, smartphone notifications, or Alexa integration.
-	Still pressure-based, so some false alarms are possible with restless movement.

## Quick Decision Guide
- Choose SafeWander if family members need remote phone alerts and the goal is to avoid false alarms and avoid frightening the person.
- Choose Lunderg if caregivers are always in the home and a simple, local pager alert is sufficient.
