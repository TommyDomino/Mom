Absolutely — let’s walk through this **step‑by‑step, end‑to‑end**, exactly as you asked, with **no assumptions left implicit**.

I’ll cover:

1.  **What SafeWander actually consists of (hardware & software)**
2.  **What gets installed in your loved one’s home**
3.  **What family members need (remote)**
4.  **How bed and wheelchair detection works during hip/pelvis recovery**
5.  **Day‑1 setup checklist**
6.  **Daily use and what happens when she gets up**
7.  **Important safety and practical considerations**

I’ll keep this grounded in a **real home scenario**, not a brochure.

## 1️⃣ What SafeWander Is (at a glance)

SafeWander is a **wearable exit‑detection system** designed to detect **the specific motion of getting up** (sit‑to‑stand), not general movement.

It consists of:

*   A **small wearable sensor** (clips to clothing)
*   A **receiver path** (Bluetooth → phone or optional gateway → internet)
*   A **mobile app** that sends alerts to caregivers’ phones

There is **no audible alarm required in the room**.

***

## 2️⃣ Equipment Required in Your Loved One’s Home

### ✅ Required components (minimum viable setup)

#### ✅ **SafeWander wearable sensor**

*   Very small, lightweight
*   Clips onto clothing (waistband, belt area, or upper garment)
*   Battery lasts **months** (not days)

This is what actually detects “she is getting up.”

***

#### ✅ **One always‑on smartphone in the home** *(critical)*

You need **one phone physically located with her** that acts as the **local receiver**.

**Requirements for this phone:**

*   iPhone or Android (supported by SafeWander app)
*   Bluetooth enabled (always on)
*   Internet access (Wi‑Fi or cellular)
*   Plugged in and charging at all times
*   Screen can stay locked

📌 **This phone does NOT need to be hers**  
It can be:

*   A spare family phone
*   An older iPhone/Android reset for this purpose
*   Mounted on a charger in her bedroom or living area

Think of it as the **“home hub phone.”**

***

#### ✅ **Internet connectivity**

One of:

*   Home Wi‑Fi **(preferred)**
*   Or cellular data on the hub phone

If the hub phone has internet, alerts will reach family **anywhere**.

***

### ✅ Optional (recommended in some homes)

#### ➕ **SafeWander Gateway**

*   Small plug‑in device
*   Used if:
    *   Bluetooth range is inconsistent
    *   The phone cannot reliably stay close
    *   You want redundancy

For most apartments or bedrooms, **the phone alone is sufficient**.

## 3️⃣ What Family Members Need (Remote)

Each family member who should be alerted needs:

### ✅ A smartphone (iOS or Android)

*   Install the **SafeWander app**
*   Log in using the shared caregiver account
*   Enable:
    *   Push notifications
    *   Critical alerts (recommended)
    *   Do‑not‑disturb bypass (recommended)

📲 **No special hardware**
📲 **No pager**
📲 **No Alexa required**
📲 **No subscription phone service**

Alerts arrive as **push notifications**.

## 4️⃣ How Bed *and* Wheelchair Detection Works (Hip/Pelvis Fracture Scenario)

This is the most important part for your case.

### ✅ Where the sensor is worn

For someone with a **hip/pelvis fracture**, best placement is:

*   **At the waist or hip area**, clipped to:
    *   Elastic waistband
    *   Pajama pants
    *   Hospital pants
    *   Belt loop (if used)
*   On the **side of the body**, not centered

Why:

*   SafeWander’s algorithm looks for **body orientation change**
*   This location best detects **sit‑to‑stand motion**

***

### ✅ Bed exit detection

While she is lying or sitting up in bed:

*   ✅ Rolling
*   ✅ Repositioning
*   ✅ Leg movement
*   ✅ Adjusting pillows

…**will NOT trigger an alert**

When she:

*   Sits up fully
*   Begins to stand
*   Shifts weight forward to rise

➡️ **Alert is triggered immediately**

This gives family time to respond **before a fall**.

***

### ✅ Wheelchair exit detection

When she is seated in a wheelchair:

*   Shifting weight
*   Adjusting posture
*   Leaning

…does **not** trigger alerts.

When she:

*   Pushes up from the chair
*   Begins a stand or transfer
*   Lifts her center of gravity

➡️ **Alert is triggered**

This is exactly why SafeWander works well during **hip fracture recovery**.

## 5️⃣ Day‑1 Setup Checklist (Concrete)

### ✅ In the home

1.  Plug in the **hub phone**
2.  Install SafeWander app
3.  Pair the wearable sensor
4.  Clip sensor to her clothing
5.  Confirm Bluetooth connection
6.  Confirm internet connectivity
7.  Send a test alert

### ✅ For family members

1.  Install app
2.  Accept caregiver access
3.  Enable notifications
4.  Test alert receipt
5.  Agree on response roles (who calls, who checks in)

⏱️ Typical setup time: **15–30 minutes**

***

## 6️⃣ What Happens When She Gets Up (Real‑World Flow)

Let’s say it’s 2:30 AM.

1.  She begins to stand from bed
2.  Sensor detects sit‑to‑stand motion
3.  Hub phone receives event via Bluetooth
4.  App sends push notifications immediately
5.  **All family caregivers receive alerts**
6.  No noise in her room
7.  No startling sound
8.  Family can:
    *   Call her phone
    *   Call a neighbor
    *   Call emergency services if needed

⏱️ Alert latency: **seconds**

***

## 7️⃣ Important Practical Considerations (Very Important)

### ✅ Clothing management

*   Sensor must remain clipped
*   Use:
    *   Consistent clothing
    *   Staff/family reminder during dressing
*   Avoid loose nightgowns without attachment points

***

### ✅ Battery management

*   Check sensor battery **weekly**
*   Hub phone stays plugged in
*   Enable low‑battery notifications

***

### ✅ Privacy & dignity

*   No cameras required
*   No microphones
*   No continuous monitoring
*   Only alerts on **getting up**

This is one reason SafeWander is often better tolerated.

***

## 8️⃣ Is This Enough Without Alexa?

For your scenario:

> **80+ years old**  
> **Hip/pelvis fracture**  
> **Home alone**  
> **Family fully remote**  
> **Primary risk = unassisted bed or wheelchair exit**

### ✅ **Yes — SafeWander alone is sufficient and appropriate**

Alexa would add:

*   Voice‑activated help
*   Reassurance
*   Medication reminders

…but it is **not required** for:

*   Exit detection
*   Family alerts
*   Silent operation

In many cases, Alexa adds **complexity without improving fall prevention**.

***

## ✅ Final Summary (Plain English)

### In the home:

*   SafeWander wearable sensor
*   One always‑on smartphone (hub)
*   Internet connection
*   Optional gateway (if needed)

### For family:

*   Smartphones with SafeWander app
*   Push notifications enabled

### What you get:

*   Silent alerts
*   Very low false alarms
*   Bed + wheelchair coverage
*   No subscription
*   No nurse‑call infrastructure
*   No Alexa required

***

If you want next, I can:

*   Create a **printed setup checklist** for family or aides
*   Help you decide **exact sensor placement** for her body type
*   Compare **SafeWander vs Wi‑Fi floor sensors** one last time before purchase

Just tell me what would be most helpful.
