You’re thinking about this **exactly the right way**, and your instinct is correct:

> **Yes — PalCare, RCare, Austco, Hillrom, etc. only make practical sense if the facility already has (or is willing to install) the supporting infrastructure.**

Below is a **clear, practical playbook** you can use when talking to a Memory Care facility, broken into:

1.  How to ask if they **already support** PalCare / RCare / similar
2.  How to ask if they’re **open to starting** such infrastructure now
3.  **Product‑specific phrasing** (PalCare vs RCare)
4.  What answers mean **“yes,” “maybe,” or “no”**
5.  A short **email + verbal script** you can actually use

No sales fluff — this is written for families advocating for a resident.

# 1️⃣ First: Confirming Existing Infrastructure (Most Important Step)

You want to determine whether the facility already has:

*   A **wireless nurse‑call platform**
*   **Mobile alerts / escalation**
*   Support for **bed and chair sensor pads**

### ✅ The *best* way to ask (neutral, non‑technical)

> **“What nurse call or resident monitoring system do you currently use in the memory care unit?”**

This single question is powerful because:

*   Facilities **know the system name**
*   You’ll quickly hear “PalCare,” “RCare,” “Hillrom,” etc.
*   If they hesitate or say “call buttons only,” that’s a signal

### Follow‑up clarifier (if needed)

> **“Does that system support bed‑exit and chair‑exit monitoring with silent alerts to staff phones or pagers?”**

✅ If they say *yes* → you’re in good shape  
⚠️ If they say *not sure* → ask for the nurse manager or administrator  
❌ If they say *no* → infrastructure likely isn’t in place

***

# 2️⃣ Product‑Specific Confirmation Questions

Once you know *what* they use, you can ask targeted questions.

***

## 🟦 If You’re Asking About **PalCare**

PalCare is common in senior living, so ask **directly**:

> **“Do you currently use PalCare in this memory care unit, including PalCare Mobile for staff alerts?”**

Then:

> **“If so, can bed‑exit and chair‑exit pads be added for a single resident?”**

✅ A strong “yes” sounds like:

*   “Yes, we’re already on PalCare”
*   “We use PalCare Mobile”
*   “Adding a bed or chair pad is straightforward”

🚩 Red flags:

*   “We have PalCare pendants only”
*   “We’d have to ask corporate”
*   “We don’t use the mobile app”

(That often means **partial deployment**.)

***

## 🟩 If You’re Asking About **RCare**

RCare is more compliance‑driven, so phrase it slightly differently:

> **“Do you use RCare for nurse call or response tracking in memory care?”**

Then:

> **“Does your RCare setup support bed‑exit and chair‑exit monitoring with escalation if staff don’t acknowledge?”**

✅ Strong yes:

*   “Yes, RCare tracks response times”
*   “We already have bed/chair pads available”

🚩 Red flags:

*   “We only use RCare for documentation”
*   “That’s handled by another system”

***

## 🟥 If You Hear **Hillrom / Austco**

That usually means **hospital‑grade infrastructure**:

> **“Is your Hillrom/Austco system configured for resident monitoring in memory care, or primarily for skilled nursing?”**

If they say “mostly skilled nursing,” adding monitoring **just for one resident** may be impractical.

***

# 3️⃣ If They *Don’t* Have the Infrastructure — How to Ask About Starting It

This is where tone matters. You want to frame this as:

*   **Resident safety**
*   **Pilot / limited scope**
*   **Low disruption**

***

## ✅ The *right* framing

> **“Given her recent hip fracture, we’re very concerned about unassisted transfers. If you don’t currently use bed‑ and chair‑exit monitoring, would the facility be open to piloting it for one resident if it improves safety?”**

Key words:

*   *Pilot*
*   *One resident*
*   *Safety*

This lowers resistance immediately.

***

## 🟦 If You Prefer **PalCare**

PalCare is often sold as *incremental*, so ask this way:

> **“If you’re not already using PalCare in this unit, would you be open to adding it on a limited basis for one memory‑care resident as a safety pilot?”**

Follow with:

> **“We understand there may be a subscription; we’re happy to discuss how that would work for a single resident.”**

Why this works:

*   PalCare supports **partial rollouts**
*   Facilities like pilots with clear justification (hip fracture)

***

## 🟩 If You Prefer **RCare**

RCare is more operational, so frame around compliance:

> **“Would you consider adding bed‑ and chair‑exit monitoring through a platform like RCare for a single high‑risk resident, to document response times and reduce fall risk?”**

This appeals to:

*   Liability reduction
*   Survey readiness
*   Compliance metrics

# 4️⃣ How to Interpret Their Answer (This Is Critical)

| What they say                            | What it really means   |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| “Yes, we already use that”               | ✅ Green light          |
| “We use part of it”                      | ⚠️ Needs clarification |
| “We’d have to check with corporate”      | ⚠️ Possible, slow      |
| “We don’t do that here”                  | ❌ Not supported        |
| “We rely on rounding instead”            | ❌ No infrastructure    |
| “We can’t support that for one resident” | ❌ Won’t pilot          |

# 5️⃣ One‑Page Script You Can Use (Verbal or Email)

### **Opening**

> “My mother is 80 and recovering from a fractured hip. Preventing unassisted bed or chair transfers is extremely important for her safety.”

### **Infrastructure Check**

> “What nurse call or resident monitoring system do you currently use in this memory care unit?”

### **Capability Check**

> “Does that system support bed‑exit and chair‑exit monitoring with silent alerts to staff?”

### **If Yes**

> “Great — would it be possible to add bed and chair pads for her specifically?”

### **If No**

> “Would the facility be open to piloting bed‑ and chair‑exit monitoring for one resident if it improves safety and reduces fall risk?”

***

# ✅ Bottom‑Line Guidance

*   ✔ **Yes**, PalCare / RCare only make sense **if infrastructure exists or the facility is willing to install it**
*   ✔ The **best first question** is *not* about products — it’s about **what system they already use**
*   ✔ If infrastructure exists, adding one resident is often easy
*   ✔ If it doesn’t, your best chance is a **safety‑driven pilot request**
*   ❌ If a facility refuses both, that’s a **capability limitation**, not a family failure

***

If you want, next I can:

*   Draft a **polite but firm email** tailored to a specific facility
*   Help you **decide PalCare vs RCare** based on how the facility answers
*   Create a **decision matrix** to compare multiple facilities objectively

Just tell me how you want to proceed.
